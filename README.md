### Introduction

**nf-core/vipr** is a bioinformatics best-practice analysis pipeline
for assembly and intrahost / low-frequency variant calling for viral
samples.

The pipeline uses [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io), a
bioinformatics workflow tool. It pre-processes raw data from FastQ
inputs, aligns the reads and performs extensive quality-control on the
results.



### Pipeline Steps

| Step                                                | Main program/s                      |
|-----------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Trimming, combining of read-pairs per sample and QC | Skewer, FastQC                      |
| Decontamination                                     | decont                              |
| Metagenomics classifcation / Sample purity          | Kraken                              |
| Assembly to contigs                                 | BBtools' Tadpole                    |
| Assembly polishing                                  | ViPR Tools                          |
| Mapping to assembly                                 | BWA, LoFreq                         |
| Low frequency variant calling                       | LoFreq                              |
| Coverage and variant AF plots                       | Bedtools, ViPR Tools                |



### Documentation

Documentation about the pipeline can be found in the `docs/` directory:

1. [Installation and configuration](docs/installation.md)
2. [Running the pipeline](docs/usage.md)
3. [Output and how to interpret the results](docs/output.md)


### Credits

This pipeline was originally developed at the
[Genome Institute of Singapore](http://a-star.edu.sg/gis) by
[Andreas Wilm](https://github.com/andreas-wilm/). It started out as an
ecosystem around LoFreq and went through a couple of iterations. The
current version had three predecessors
[ViPR 1](https://github.com/CSB5/vipr),
[ViPR 2](https://github.com/CSB5/vipr2) and
[ViPR 3](https://github.com/gis-rpd/pipelines/tree/master/germs/vipr).

An incomplete list of publications using (previous versions of) ViPR:

- [Sessions et. al., PLoS Negl Trop Dis., 2015](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26327586)
- [Sim et al., PLoS Negl Trop Dis., 2015](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26325059)

Plenty of people provided essential feedback, including:

- [October SESSIONS](https://www.duke-nus.edu.sg/content/sessions-october)
- [Paola Florez DE SESSIONS](https://www.a-star.edu.sg/gis/Our-People/Platform-Leaders)
- ZHU Yuan
- Shuzhen SIM
- CHU Wenhan Collins

### Participating Institutes

nfcore/vipr is used mainly by the Bioinformatics Core of the Genome
Institue of Singapore. If you use this pipeline too, please let us
know in an issue and we will add you to the list.
